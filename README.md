## <p align="center"> Side Quest Introduction: </p>

We are privileged to witness highly motivated hackers create captivating projects within remarkably short timeframes. Yet, often these innovative projects vanish post-hackathon, left dormant in a GitHub repository. To counter this trend, we are introducing a side-quest aimed at transforming hackathon ideas into viable businesses.

Our request is straightforward. As participants already craft pitches for their solutions, we encourage you to develop a comprehensive pitch deck that outlines your full business plan. The objective is to engage your case partner as your inaugural customer, secure funding from venture capitalists and investors, and achieve recognition through competitions and grants. This initiative not only seeks to preserve the ingenuity displayed at hackathons but also to propel these ideas into successful, tangible ventures.

The pitch deck should evolve from the initial product pitch, enhanced by comprehensive market research, competitor analysis, financial projections, a development roadmap, and a go-to-market strategy. We invite you to invest an additional hour or two in refining your solution, contemplating deeply on its potential as a business. This involves crafting a detailed business plan for the project you've developed, thereby laying the groundwork for its transformation into a sustainable venture.

## <p align="center"> Judging Criteria: </p>

We are eager to witness the transformation of your hackathon ideas into potential startups. To facilitate this, we're looking for a well-thought-out business plan that includes considerations for financials, market size, and competition, among other aspects. Below is a detailed overview of our evaluation criteria for your project:

1. **Problem and Solution (20%)** - Clearly define the problem your project addresses and the solution it offers.
2. **Market Analysis / Market Size Estimation (10%)** - Provide insights into the market you're entering and estimate its size.
3. **Competitor Analysis (10%)** - Analyze your competitors and understand where your project stands in comparison.
4. **Roadmap (10%)** - Outline the development and growth trajectory of your project.
5. **Business Model (20%)** - Detail how your project will generate revenue and sustain itself.
6. **Impact (10%)** - Discuss the potential impact of your project on the market or society.

8. **Financial Projection (10%)** - Offer realistic financial forecasts for your project.

Please note, our focus is on the accuracy and thoughtfulness of your projections and analyses, rather than optimistic figures. While the visual appeal of your slides is not our primary concern, some effort in slide design is appreciated. Our goal is to see that you have considered all relevant business aspects in developing your idea, aiming for feasible startup ventures rather than the most polished presentations.
