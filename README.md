## <p align="center"> Side Quest Introduction: </p>

We have very motivated hackers building mesmerizing projects in quite short time. However most of the times those projects goes missing after the hack and they are left in a github repository. Therefore we propose this side-quest to bring the ideas from the hackathon and convert them into a real business. What we ask for is simple. Since you will be already creating pitches for your solutions we will ask you to prepare a full business pitch containing the full business plan for your project with the goal to onboard your case partner as your first customer, get funding from VCs and investors as well as winning competitions and grants.

## <p align="center"> Further Information: </p>

The Business Concept Pitch should be built on top  of  the  product pitch  by  extending  it  with  Market  research, competitor analysis, financial projection, and roadmap as well as go-to-market strategy. So we are asking you to spend another hour or two on your solution and really think about how you can turn this project into a business, providing a full business plan for the project you built.
